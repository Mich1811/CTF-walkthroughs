Welcome! This repo contains my end-to-end walkthroughs for CTF rooms and labs (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box). Each write-up focuses on repeatable methodology, clear reasoning, and clean command sequences you can run without guesswork. I include both the intended path and viable alternatives when they add learning value.
